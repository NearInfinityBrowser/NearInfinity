Non-PST: (all games except PST and PST:EE)
- header column: (int/hex, composite)
  - contains the numeric animation id (usually in hexadecimal notation)
  - may contain an optional mask value (separated from id by an underscore)
    - indicates a slot range that uses the same definitions
- RESREF (string)
  - the animation prefix
- TYPE (int)
  - an index referring to a SpriteDecoder.AnimationType enum 
- ELLIPSE (int)
  - the selection circle radius
- SPACE (int)
  - the personal space in search map units
- BLENDING (int)
  - a bitfield: bit0=brightest, bit1=multiply_blend, bit2=light_source
- PALETTE (string)
  - resref of a replacement palette
  - meaning depends on animation type
- PALETTE2 (string)
  - resref of a secondary replacement palette
  - meaning depends on animation type
- TRANSLUCENT (boolean)
  - whether animation is semi-transparent
- CLOWN (bool)
  - whether false color replacement is enabled
- SPLIT (bool)
  - whether animations are spread over multiple sub-BAMs
  - animation type "effect": specifies "random_render" attribute
- HELMET (bool/int)
  - animation types "character", "character_old": whether helmet overlay is drawn
  - animation types "monster_layered", "monster_quadrant": specifies "caster" attribute
  - animation type "effect": specifies BAM cycle
- WEAPON (bool)
  - animation type "character_old": whether weapon overlay is drawn
  - animation type "monster_iwd": specifies "weapon_left_handed" attribute
  - animation type "monster_layered": specifies "dual_attack" attribute
- HEIGHT (string)
  - animation type "character", "character_old": overlay prefix for weapons and helmets
  - animation type "monster_layered": specifies "resref_weapon1" attribute
  - animation type "effect": if SPLIT=1: specifies a second BAM resref to be used randomly
- HEIGHT_SHIELD (string)
  - animation type "character": overlay prefix for shields
  - animation type "monster_layered": specifies "resref_weapon2" attribute


PST: (PST and PST:EE only)
- header column: (int/hex)
  - contains the base part of the numeric animation id (usually in hexadecimal notation)
  - high byte value is determined by the animation class
  - slots with id >= 0x1000 are handled specially
- RESREF (string)
  - combination of prefix (one char), resref (3 chars) and suffix (one char)
    - prefix "c" indicates slot range (PST: 0xE000, PSTEE: 0xF000)
    - prefix "d" indicates slot range (PST: 0x6000, PSTEE: 0xF000)
  - action prefix is determined by the animation class
  - special animation slots are added verbatim
- RESREF2 (string)
  - contains a secondary BAM resref used by a small number of special animation slots
- TYPE (int)
  - an index referring to a SpriteDecoder.AnimationType enum 
- ELLIPSE (int)
  - the selection circle radius
- SPACE (int)
  - the personal space in search map units
- CLOWN (int)
  - number of false color ranges to replace (* indicates disabled false color replacement)
- ARMOR (int)
  - (currently) unused by NI
- BESTIARY (int)
  - (currently) unused by NI
